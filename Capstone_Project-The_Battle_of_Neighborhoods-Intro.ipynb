To have more good IT solutions, it is a good idea to open IT comunity office, that will provide a good open, wide space for software developers to have place where they can work in safe and productive way. Since that kind of office will not have a kitchen, it would be necessary to have great resaturants and caffe near the office, so the developers could have a break with good food or drink.\nBeside good restaurants, it is important that neighborhood has some green area, where people can go outside and relax.\nIt comunity office should have space for up to 100 developers, so it is good to find location in neighborhood in big city. This can be of interest to people in Toronto, because Toronto is the largest city in Canada. Also it can be of interest to people in New York, because New York is the largest city in USA."
